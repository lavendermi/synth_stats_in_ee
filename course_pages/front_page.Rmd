## Course description

This course will provide an introduction and overview of approaches for synthesizing the highly structured, multi-sourced datasets that typify ecology, evolution, and environmental research, including data collation, integration, analysis, and visualization. Students will learn how to define their research question and scope in the context of other studies in their subfield and how to find and fill in gaps in understanding with additional datasets. We will also provide a broad overview of the different types of methods used for synthesizing data including hierarchical models, meta-analysis, model integration, and model updating, providing students a guide to navigating these methods and identifying methods to learn and use in their research. Students will develop skills in R programming, collaborative research, reproducible workflows, data analysis, and communication.

## Territorial acknowledgement

The Living Data Project is a collaborative effort by researchers at institutions across Canada. We collectively acknowledge that we live and work on the traditional, ancestral, treaty, and unceded territories of many Indigenous peoples, including the Coast Salish Peoples, xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Syilx (Okanagan), nêhiyawak (Cree), anihšināpēk (Saulteaux), Dakota, Lakota, Nakoda, Attawanderon, Mississaugas, kanien'kehà:ka (Mohawk), and Haudenosaunee, and the homeland of the Métis/Michif Nation. The LDP brings together instructors and students from many different places with distinct Indigenous traditions and colonial histories.

We encourage all participants to seek more information about the traditional territories on which they live: [https://native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/)\
